# NotT3Chat: The C# Answer to the T3 Stack

 <img src="stuff/logo.png" width="350" />


Welcome to **NotT3Chat**, a fully-featured, real-time chat application built for the [cloneathon.t3.chat](https://cloneathon.t3.chat). This project serves as a testament to the raw power and elegance of C# and ASP.NET Core, proving that you don't need TypeScript to build amazing, modern web applications. (Sorry, Theo.)

## 🤔 Why?

Why build another chat app? Two reasons:

1.  To participate in the T3 Clone-a-thon and have some fun.
2.  To lovingly poke at the T3 stack and demonstrate that a robust, type-safe, and high-performance application can be built with the glorious combination of **C# on the backend** and plain ol' JavaScript on the front. It's a love letter to backend developers who appreciate strongly-typed languages that *aren't* a superset of JavaScript.

## ✨ Core Features

This is far from just a "hello world" chat. We've packed in some serious features:

*   **🤖 Multi-LLM Support:** Seamlessly switch between different models and providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Groq, DeepSeek, and more). Add custom providers via config.
*   **⚡ Blazing-Fast Real-Time Chat:** Built with the magic of **[SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/signalr)**, messages stream in real-time.
*   **🔄 Advanced Stream Resumption:** Did you close your browser tab mid-stream? No problem. Re-open the chat, and the stream will pick up right where it left off.
*   **🤝 Multi-Session Sync:** Open the same chat in multiple windows or on different devices, and watch the messages stream in perfect sync across all of them.
*   **🔐 Flexible Authentication:** Email/password login and/or Google OAuth. Configure what you need.
*   **🎨 Customizable Branding:** Custom fonts, logos, titles, and icons via environment variables.
*   **📜 Chat History:** All your conversations are saved and can be revisited anytime.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & How It Was Built

This project was a collaboration between human and machine.

### Backend
![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/.NET-8.0-512BD4?style=for-the-badge&logo=dotnet)
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-12.0-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white)
![SignalR](https://img.shields.io/badge/SignalR-realtime-F76423?style=for-the-badge)
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-3-003B57?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

The backend was primarily built by me, with some expert consulting from **Sonnet 4**. The goal was a lean, powerful, and scalable foundation using ASP.NET Core 8. The multi-LLM support is powered by the fantastic **[LlmTornado.Toolkit](https://github.com/lofcz/LlmTornado)** library – a huge shout-out for making the integration so seamless. Hoping to move to ASP.NET Core 10 soon. 

### Frontend
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-19-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB)
![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-5.0-646CFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=vite&logoColor=white)
![MUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/MUI-5-007FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=mui&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-ES6-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

The UI was mostly crafted with the help of **Claude Code**. It was a surprisingly smooth experience, resulting in a clean, component-based React app built with Vite and styled with MUI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
    *   On Ubuntu 22+: `apt update && apt install dotnet-sdk-8.0`
*   [Node.js v18+](https://nodejs.org/)

### 1. Launching the Backend

The backend runs on port `http://localhost:5128` by default in debug mode.

**Configuration:**

The backend reads configuration from environment variables and `appsettings.json`:

```bash
# LLM Provider API Keys
# Options: GOOGLE_API_KEY, OAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, COHERE_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY, DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, MISTRAL_API_KEY, XAI_API_KEY, PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
export XXXXXX_API_KEY=... # or use dotnet user-secrets set, better

# Optional: Filter which models to display
export NOTT3CHAT_MODELS_FILTER=gpt-4o-mini,gemini-2.0-flash-001,gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001

# Optional: Model for chat title generation (default: gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001)
export NOTT3CHAT_TITLE_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001

# Optional: Google OAuth (requires Google Cloud Console setup)
dotnet user-secrets set "Authentication:Google:ClientId" "your-client-id"
dotnet user-secrets set "Authentication:Google:ClientSecret" "your-client-secret"
```

Edit `appsettings.json` for additional settings:

```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "UseGoogle": false,      // Enable Google OAuth login
    "UseIdentity": true      // Enable email/password login
  },
  "CustomProviders": [       // Add custom LLM providers
    {
      "Name": "MyProvider",
      "BaseUrl": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "ApiKey": "your-key", // can also be specific "CustomProviders:0:ApiKey"
      "Models": ["model-name-1", "model-name-2"]
    }
  ],
  "FrontEndUrl": "http://localhost:5173"  // For OAuth redirects
}
```

**Debug Mode:**
```bash
dotnet run --project backend/NotT3ChatBackend.csproj
```
> **Note:** The first time you run this, it will create a `databse.dat` SQLite file. When running in debug it will seed it with a default user:
> - **Username:** `admin@example.com`
> - **Password:** `admin`

**Production Mode:**
```bash
# Build for production
dotnet publish backend/NotT3ChatBackend.csproj -c Release -o publish

# Run the published app (example on port 5555)
dotnet publish/NotT3ChatBackend.dll --urls http://0.0.0.0:5555
```

> A few warnings: 
> 1. We use MemoryCache right now for synchronization, we will use Redis in the future but this means that it only works on a single server instance, no load balancer. 
> 2. Cors policy right now is any domain allowed, feel free to change it yourself. 
> 3. The password requirements are very minimal, feel free to change it yourself. 

### 2. Launching the Frontend

The frontend dev server will connect to the backend API.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd front-end

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
# Make sure this URL matches your backend's URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5128 npm run dev
```

**Frontend Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the `front-end` directory with these optional settings:

```bash
# Required: Backend API URL
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5128

# Optional: Custom branding
VITE_APP_TITLE=NotT3Chat
VITE_APP_SLOGAN=Your AI Chat Companion
VITE_CUSTOM_FONT_URL=https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap
VITE_CUSTOM_FONT_FAMILY=Inter
VITE_CUSTOM_ASSISTANT_ICON_URL=https://example.com/icon.png
VITE_CUSTOM_PROVIDER_FALLBACK_ICON_URL=https://example.com/provider-icon.png

# Optional: Authentication methods (defaults to true for identity, false for google)
VITE_USE_IDENTITY_AUTH=true
VITE_USE_GOOGLE_AUTH=false
```

## 💻 Developer's Corner

Some notes on the current state of the codebase for aspiring contributors.

### Backend Philosophy
The backend is currently in a single `Program.cs` file. This is an intentional experiment in anticipation of .NET 10's enhanced support for single-file applications (`dotnet run app.cs`). We are going to split it into a more traditional file structure for clarity soon. It's a WIP!

### Frontend Styling Rules
To maintain sanity without TypeScript, we follow a few simple styling rules:

1.  **Component Styling:** Use components from **MUI** whenever possible.
2.  **Class Names:** For multiple conditional class names on an element, use the `light-classnames` library.
3.  **No Inline Styles:** All styling should be done via class names in dedicated `.css` files. **No inline `style` or `sx` props.**
4.  **No `!important`:** If you feel the need to use `!important`, take a break, have some water, and refactor.

### Technical To-Do List

- [x] Graceful error handling (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests, content filter blocks). (More or less done, can always be improved)
- [x] Streamline adding new models via environment variables instead of code changes.
- [ ] Add configuration to easily switch between db providers (In-Memory, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- [ ] Consider segmenting larger UI components into smaller, more focused ones.
- [ ] Add an easy way to specify a default user account via environment variables for local development.
- [x] Logging
- [ ] Add configuration to move to redis for distributed cache for better synchronization & locking for actively streaming chats.
- [x] Fix general chat events to always stream (delete, title, new)
